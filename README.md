# CAPTCHA Cracker

A Python-based deep learning pipeline that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize text from distorted CAPTCHA images.

## Features
- Preprocessing with binarization and morphological transformations
- Character-level prediction using ResNet50 architecture
- Includes academic research write-up and runnable Jupyter code

## Files
- `resnet50.ipynb`: Main training/testing code
- `Captcha resnet50 final code.html`: Static HTML preview of the code output
- `Capstone Research Paper.docx`: Project overview and methodology

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your backend)
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
```bash
# Run the notebook in Jupyter
jupyter notebook resnet50.ipynb

```
